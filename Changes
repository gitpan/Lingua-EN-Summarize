	- HTML::FormatText sucked major cojones, so I replaced it with a
	  simple bit of manual HTML::Parser code.
	- Fixed a completely idiotic bug that should have been caught in
	  testing related to Text::Wrap and the "wrap" option.
	- Actually made the 'wrap' option work as documented.
	- Changed the way extra whitespace gets stripped at the end.
	- Fixed a warning caused by a document with no valid clauses.
